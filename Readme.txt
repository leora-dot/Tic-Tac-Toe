This is a console tic-tac-toe game for two players. Game_script contains the game, and test_script is used to validate whether the game is correctly recognizing winning moves.

Tic Tac Toe was Tyler's idea, and he challenged me to write it so that the the code minimizes the number of board spaces that it needs to check in order to know whether or not the game has been won. This version of the game also uses matplotlibrary to visualize the board.

Key lessons learned:
1) Don't use global variables!
2) Seperate scripts, seperate namespaces. 
3) Harder to test something than to build it. 
4) Need to learn more about how pandas handles data types.
